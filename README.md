# Fine-Tuning LLM for Multiple Tasks

Welcome to the `fine-tunning-llm-for-multiple-task` repository! This project focuses on fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to perform multiple tasks, such as text generation and text translation. The main scripts for these processes are encapsulated in the Jupyter notebooks `text_generation.ipynb` and `text_translation(eng----fr).ipynb`.

## Overview

This repository demonstrates how to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) for multiple tasks, enhancing their ability to generate text and translate text from English to French. The flexibility and power of LLMs make them suitable for a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

## Requirements

To run the fine-tuning processes, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- PyTorch
- Transformers (Hugging Face)
- Datasets (Hugging Face)
- CUDA (for GPU support)

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imanoop7/fine-tunning-llm-for-multiple-task.git
cd fine-tunning-llm-for-multiple-task
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Open the Jupyter notebooks and follow the steps to fine-tune your models:

1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. Open the desired notebook in your browser:
   - For text generation, open `text_generation.ipynb`.
   - For text translation (English to French), open `text_translation(eng----fr).ipynb`.

3. Follow the instructions within the notebooks to load the datasets, configure the models, and initiate the fine-tuning process.

## Notebooks

### Text Generation

The notebook `text_generation.ipynb` demonstrates how to fine-tune a language model to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given prompt.

### Text Translation (English to French)

The notebook `text_translation(eng----fr).ipynb` demonstrates how to fine-tune a language model to accurately translate text from English to French.
